This simulator accepts blocks and word memory mode for cache and addresses. This simulates the direct cache mapping of memory addresses in different possible scenarios given a mode of cache and memory.

- When inputting a block sequence of addresses, main memory input is not required as mapping will be based from the block sequence of addresses (in decimal)
- When inputting a word sequence of addresses, the simulator will accept binary input

This simulator performs the necessary conversion of cache blocks and word addresses to bits in order to successfully perform a simulation of given inputs

For a successful simulation, the program will output the number of cache hits, number of cache miss, miss penalty, average memory 
access time, total memory access time, snapshot of the cache memory. 

The simulator also has an option to output result in text file.

Commands:
1. `open index.html`
